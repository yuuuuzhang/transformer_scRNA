# transformer_scRNA
Use encoder only transformer to make prediction of cell clusters from sparse single cell RNA-seq data. 
Tested the model on two public scRNA-seq data. 
Compared performance of raw counts and normalised data from the same dataset, this model performs much better on raw count data than normalised data.
